# IrishHumanWelfare

This application was built as a part of the project which was required by the module "Software Architecture" in our second semester of Master's course where the main focus was to develop an application using various software design patterns and software architecture patterns. So keeping that in mind, we developed an application which helps users to make charity. We integrated five design patterns and three architectural patterns. The application is built using Flask (Python web framework), MySQL and basic HTML, CSS. Entire CICD flow was maintained throughout the project. The quality of the source code was evaluated using Sonar Cloud.
