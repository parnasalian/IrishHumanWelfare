# IrishHumanWelfare

This application was required by the module "Software Architecture" in our second semester of Master's course where the main moto was to develop an application by integrating software design patterns and software architecture patterns. So keeping that in mind, we developed an application which helps users to make charity. We integrated five design patterns and three architectural patterns.
